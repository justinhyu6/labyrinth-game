## Labyrinth
This is a game made for my 15-112 term project, based on the rules of the board game Labyrinth. In this game, you are a Wizard, and you are trying to find all of your magical objects in a constantly changing maze. 

## How to run the project
Run the file board.py in an editor. The fonts m3x6 and Gothic Pixel Font should also be installed by running the .ttf files

## Shortcut Commands
* ‘0’ - restart the game at any time
* ‘3’ - skip to the board creation, with default values (4 players and 0 AI)

## Shortcut commands in game
* ‘1’ - give Red Player one treasure found
* ‘2‘ - miniMax AI, only works for two players
* ‘4’ - game tree AI, works for any amount of players, faster
